# NapScript
The only true cat programming language. Made by a cat for people. This is the way. 

## Origins
NapScript is called after my most favourite thing - naps. Love them, can't have enough of them. When I don't nap, I munch and when I don't do that, I write my cat language. 

Unfortunately `MeowScript` and `Meow lang` were taken. Amateurs. NapScript will be the best language, obviously. 

## Contributing
Feel free to PR with your ideas. Don't promise anything though. My language, my rules. If you don't like it, go play with your human languages and your opposing thumbs. 

PRs from cats üêà take priority.
